# A darkhttpd clone

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tronje/brownhttpd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tronje/brownhttpd)

It's written in Rust, because everything is better when you rewrite it in Rust.

Just kidding. I wanted to write *something* in Rust, and this was it.
If you want to use it, follow these steps:

1. Use darkhttpd instead
2. There are no more steps

If, for some reason, you still really want to use this, `git clone` and `cargo run` should do the trick.
You know how to do it.
